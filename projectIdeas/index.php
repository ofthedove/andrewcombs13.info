	<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
	<h2>A bunch of ideas for projects, originally for inspiration at hackathons</h2>
	<h2>It's a mix of hardware and software projects</h2>
	<h3>(These are sorted chronologically, from oldest to newest. I'm working on it.)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>Ultrasonic radar</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Use a stepper to spin an ultrasonic sensor around. Read the distance values and display on a radar-like screen.</p>
            <p>I used this one as a final project for a class.</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Money to scholarships</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Make a browser extension that converts large sums of money to the number of scholarships that money could fund. Have settings for what school and full ride vs full scholarship, etc.</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Word search solver with ocr</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Solve word-search puzzles. This would be really fun from an algorithmic point of view. Hard mode - use OCR to run it on paper puzzles</p>
            <p>I was on a team that implemented this at a hackathon, link <a href="https://devpost.com/software/lexitrek">here</a></p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Detachable proximity sensor</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Build a motion detector and RF transmitter that you can set somewhere. Also build a device with an RF receiver that will vibrate/buzz/light up when the motion detector 'sees' someone. Never have someone sneak up behind you again!</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Smart medicine cabinet</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Medicine cabinet with a magic mirror that helps you keep track of when you take your medice. Never worry about taking too much medicine while you're sick again! Could also interface with the FDA's online database to warn people of possible interactions and show potential side effects, etc.</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Phone smart charger (stops charging after full charge)</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>App on your phone would track charge level, alert an Arduino/Raspberry Pi when your phone battery is full and shut off the charger with a relay. Could even track charge time and set to hit full charge right before you wake up.</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>VHS Data Tape Backup</h3>

		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Distributed temperature sensor thermostat w/ window directions</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>One of the biggest issues with thermostats is that they only sense temperature in one place in your house. Use a network of wifi-connected temperature sensors to get an average temperature, and build a thermostat off that. Bonus points: have a sensor outside and have the thermostat reccomend opening windows when more efficient that running HVAC. Maybe even integrate with online pollution index.</p>

			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Better delete history</h3>
			<div class="copy">

				<p>Generates random law suit documents using basic AI. Allows you to pronounce sewing machine wrong with impunity.</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Better motion lights</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Motion lights that don't turn off when they stop seeing motion, they turn off when they sense motion somewhere else. Only really works if there's only one person though... This idea still needs work</p>

		<li>
			<h3>San Francisco style Smart parking</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Apparently San Francisco has some really cool parking policies, with variable pricing based on demand. A lot of other cities could benefit from a similar setup. <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/episode-08-99-free-parking/">Here's the 99pi I got inspiration from.</a></p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Smart Street Lights</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Inspired by MIT moon sensitive street light prototype. (<a href="http://www.civiltwilightcollective.com/lunar-resonant-streetlights/">link?</a>) Could also add smart grid integration. (Also see <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/drive-monitoring-urban-streetlights-0916">here</a>)</p>
			</div>

			<h3>raspi + hid arduinos keyboard and mouse augmenter - macro system</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Plug your keyboard and mouse into a Raspberry Pi. The raspberry pi can "augment" your input with macros and other utilities, and then sends the data out to an HID Arduino to be sent to a computer. You could have a hardware device with record/play/repeat macro functionality.</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Morse code chat bot</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Chat bot, but communicates in Morse code. Would help with learning Morse code</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Vocal journal with compression and voice based recall</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Audio journal, but use text to speach to build an index so that you can search the voice later, and it will play back voice clips.</p>
				<p>Translated text probably wouldn't actually be available to the user, because text to speach is usually not very good.</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Phrase to TLA to techno-babel generator</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Create a program to search technical documentation for Three Letter Acronyms. Then, if you give it a three word phrase, it will find it's TLA, and all the technical terms to go with it.</p>
				<p>Could also go the other way, give it a TLA or a three word technical phrase, and get a random english phrase out! Could use Markov chains, or do it randomly</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Facebook download analyzer with sentiment analysis</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Facebook allows you to download a record of every post, image, and IM you've ever created/sent.</p>
				<p>This project would take that info, and analyze it to give you all kinds of interesting information, such as who your favorite freind is, what your favorite word is, what freind makes you the least happy, etc.</p>
				<p>Would use sentiment analysis, data mining, etc.<p>
				<p>Could also create a Facebook app, so you don't have to wait for the download. Either way, the permissions are <i>ugly.</i> Serious privacy issues here!</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Fun wifi name detector</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Create a service to detect when you connect to wifi, and check if it's name is "cool," then tell you. Would be a fun way to learn about writing background services.</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Improved Hackthon Project Idea List website</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>A better version of this, basically. I'd love to add a database back-end, for ease of use. I'd love to add tags, and searching, and filters.</p>
				<p>For example, it would be nice to sort by difficulty, seriousness, scope, hardware/software, etc.<p>
				<p>Would also be nice to have a way for people to send in a "postcard" if they use an idea here.</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Modular member info management site for ACM/others</h3>
			<div class="copy">
				<p>Create a totally modular web-system for organization management. Would have a core module with basic info on members, then add additional modules for other functionality.</p>
				<p>Each organization could include just the modules they need, so they don't have a ton of features they don't want.</p>
				<p>Moduels to include could be things like sub-group membership, mailing-list maintenance, self-update interface, etc.</p>
				<p>Would be a great way to learn about modular software design, and would create an actually useful final project for our local ACM</p>
				<p><a href="https://devpost.com/thault">Tyler</a> helped me come up with this idea, and we're hoping to work on it at a hackathon in Spring 2018</p>
